# gmake

## Usage

`gmake` is a wrapper around make written in Go.

`gmake` invokes make with any arguments that it was passed.

`gmake` looks for a Makefile or a file with a `.mk` suffix in the current working directory, if none is found it moves up to the parent directory.

This process is repeated till a Makefile is found or till the user's home directory is reached at which point `gmake` will return an error.


## Motivation

The most common mistake I make while using make ( no pun intended ) is to invoke the command from a child directory where no Makefile  is present.

I estimate I run `make` about 50 - 100 times a day and hit the above error about 90% of the time. This tool is my attempt to solve this pain.

### Alternatives

make provides a -C flag which accepts the path to the make file but that defeats the purpose as it is more effort/time consuming to type it out.
